# Privacy Policy for Focus Timer - Pomodoro Extension

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Introduction

Focus Timer - Pomodoro ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information and what data, if any, is collected, stored, or shared.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

This extension is designed with privacy in mind and operates entirely locally on your device. We believe in transparency and want you to understand exactly how your data is handled.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Collect

**Answer: We collect NO personal data from users.**

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including but not limited to:
- Names, email addresses, or contact information
- Browsing history or website visits
- Location data
- Device information
- Any other personally identifiable information

### How Data is Stored

All data created by this extension is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). This data includes:
- Timer settings (focus time, short break duration, long break duration)
- Session statistics (completed sessions, total focus minutes)
- Current timer state and mode

**This data never leaves your device and is never transmitted to external servers.**

## Permissions Used and Their Purpose

This extension requires the following permissions to function:

### 1. `notifications`
- **Purpose:** Display desktop notifications when a timer session completes
- **Data Usage:** No data is collected. Notifications are displayed locally on your device only.
- **Justification:** Essential for the Pomodoro technique, as users need to be alerted when to switch between work and break periods.

### 2. `storage`
- **Purpose:** Save timer settings, current timer state, and session statistics locally on your device
- **Data Usage:** All data is stored locally using Chrome's local storage API. No data is transmitted to external servers.
- **Justification:** Required to preserve user preferences and session progress between browser sessions.

### 3. `alarms`
- **Purpose:** Run the timer in the background even when the extension popup is closed
- **Data Usage:** No data is collected. The alarm API is used only to track time locally on your device.
- **Justification:** Ensures accurate time tracking and allows the timer to continue counting down while users work in other browser tabs or applications.

## Third-Party Services

### Unsplash API

The extension may load background images from Unsplash (if an API key is configured). 

**Important Notes:**
- Image requests are made directly from your browser to Unsplash's servers
- We do not intercept, store, or process these images
- We do not collect or transmit any data related to these image requests
- Images are displayed locally on your device only
- If you have not configured an Unsplash API key, no external requests are made

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do NOT share, sell, or disclose any data to third parties.**

Since we do not collect any data, there is no data to share or disclose.

## Data Security

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API. This data is:
- Stored only on your local device
- Never transmitted over the network
- Protected by Chrome's built-in security features
- Accessible only to the extension itself

## Your Rights and Control

You have full control over your data:

2. **Clear Your Data:** You can clear all extension data at any time by:
   - Going to `chrome://extensions/`

   - Clicking "Remove" to uninstall the extension (this will delete all stored data)
   - Or using Chrome's site data settings to clear extension storage
3. **Disable Permissions:** You can disable specific permissions in Chrome's extension settings, though this may affect functionality

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, no special considerations are needed for children's privacy.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

Your continued use of the extension after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
